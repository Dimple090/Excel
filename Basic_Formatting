Formatting in Excel is essential for making your data clear and visually appealing. Here are some key techniques for basic formatting in Excel:

### 1. **Cell Formatting**
   - **Font Styles:** Change the font, size, color, and style (bold, italic) using the Home tab.
   - **Alignment:** Adjust horizontal and vertical alignment, wrap text, and merge cells for better presentation.
   - **Borders:** Add borders to cells or ranges to enhance readability.

### 2. **Number Formatting**
   - Use different formats for numbers, such as:
     - **General:** Default format.
     - **Number:** Control decimal places.
     - **Currency:** Add currency symbols.
     - **Percentage:** Display numbers as percentages.
   - Access these options from the Home tab under the Number group.

### 3. **Cell Styles**
   - Use built-in cell styles to quickly format data (e.g., Good, Bad, Neutral) from the Home tab.

### 4. **Conditional Formatting**
   - Apply rules to format cells based on their values, which helps to highlight trends or anomalies:
     - Go to the Home tab, select "Conditional Formatting," and choose a rule (e.g., highlight cells greater than a certain value).

### 5. **Row and Column Width**
   - Adjust row heights and column widths to fit your content. Double-click the line between row numbers or column letters to auto-fit.

### 6. **Themes and Colors**
   - Use Excel's themes to apply a consistent color scheme across your workbook. You can find these under the Page Layout tab.

### 7. **Freezing Panes**
   - Keep specific rows or columns visible while scrolling. Go to the View tab and select "Freeze Panes."

### 8. **Data Validation**
   - Set rules for what data can be entered in a cell. Go to the Data tab, select "Data Validation," and configure the settings.

### Example of Formatting Steps
1. **Select the Range:** Highlight the cells you want to format.
2. **Font:** Change font to Arial, size 12, and make it bold.
3. **Number Format:** Format the selected cells as Currency.
4. **Alignment:** Center-align the text and wrap text if necessary.
5. **Borders:** Add a border around the entire range.
